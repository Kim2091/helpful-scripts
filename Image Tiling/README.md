The Image Tiling with Tile Removal script was created with ChatGPT and allows quick tiling of your images. From a quick test, it's about 2250% faster than magickutils.

Put your images in an `images` folder, and it'll output the results in `output`. This script is multithreaded and also removes any solid white or black tiles, with a small margin.


The Image Tiling script is the same as the one above, but it leaves all of the output tiles as they'd normally be.
